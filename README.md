# Starbucks Customer Data EDA
## Project Overview
This project aims to visualise customer data in relation to promotions using Tableau. By analysing the relationship between customer behaviours and promotional activities, the company can gain insights to implement more targeted and effective marketing strategies.

## Project Files
- **Data**: Cleaned data is stored in the `data/` and raw data is in the `data/raw` folder.
- **Notebooks**: The notebook for data cleaning is located in the `notebooks/` folder.
- **Scripts**: All Python scripts for data cleaning in the `scripts/` folder.
- **Results**: Visualisations can be found in the `results/figures` folder.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and splitting dictionary keys and values for easier visualisation in Tableau.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Performed visual analysis on customer demographics and promotions to understand customer behaviours and promotional activities.

## Key Findings
- **Offer Types**:Both BOGO and discount offers appear to have similar distribution levels, each around 50-60K offers. Whilst discount offers seem to be more popular than BOGO offers, the men completed the promotional offers more than the women.
- **Minimum Spend Requirements**: Discount offers appear to have larger minimum spend requirements compared to BOGO offers.
